# ENG 498/583 JS Practice

Let's start our JS journey by creating our own sandbox of primitives.

## 1. Primitives: Declaring & Assigning Variables

In your group, create a suite of the following primitives about a topic of your choice. For example, if the Strings are about ingredients to make a dish, then numbers could represent the measurement amount.

- 5 Strings with `let`
- 5 Numbers  with `const`
- 1 array for the Strings
- 1 array for the Numbers
- 1 array of 5 objects that combines the Strings and Numbers into 1

```javascript
/**
 * Convert and declare here!
**/
// 5 Strings with `let`


// 5 Numbers with `const`


// 1 array for the Strings with the variable names


// 1 array for the Numbers with the variable names


/**
 * 1 array of 5 objects that combines the Strings
 * and Numbers into 1 object as 2 properties of
 * each object
**/


```

## 2. Playing with Our Data in the Web Console

### Strings

```javascript
// Convert and play
```

### Numbers

```javascript
// Convert and play
```

---

## 3. Finding Built-In Docs Arrays & Objects in the Web Console

### Array

```javascript
// Convert and play
```

### Array of Objects

```javascript
// Convert and play
```

## 4. Conditional Statements

1. Create at least 3 conditional statements in the provided codeblock.
    <p class="note">One conditional statement should include 2 conditions to evaluate</p>
2. Log an output to the console to verify that your conditional statement was evaluated the way that you had hoped it would.

```javascript
// Convert and write your conditional statement

```
